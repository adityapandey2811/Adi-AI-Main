# Adi-AI-Main

# SCOPE:
ADI-AI is a virtual assistant app that takes user's speech as input and performs the appropriate task that is asked by the user.

# STAND OUT FEATURE:
How ADI-AI stands out from other available applications(Google assistant, alexa or siri) is that ADI-AI assistant can run without the internet connection.

# APPROACH:
ADI-AI is an android application that is purely based on Java and is developed within Android Studio. The application uses Google's speech recognition API to convert the user's voice into text. That text then goes through different algorithms to extract the data from user's voice input and that extracted data is used to call the appropriate function needed for the task. The function then runs and the user is served the output they needed. The app also uses Google API Console to provide signing function to the application. The application uses shared preference to store speech data within app for user to track their command history.

# IMPACT:
There are many people in the world who don't have proper exposure to the smart world and as the technologies are improving and enhancing day by day however user friendly they might be some people still face difficulties accessing their systems.
